# Code Quiz Challenge 

In this challenge I had to create an interactive quiz. The user must answer answers and if they get it an answer wrong 15 seconds is taken from their time. At the end of the quiz, the remaining time is their score. Once the quiz is complete the user then enters their initials and their score is saved in a highscores list. In order to do this the score and initials had to be committed to local storage. 

This challenge required me to use DOM to grab and manipulate parts of the HTML. I also practiced used event listeners to register the clicks by the user.
